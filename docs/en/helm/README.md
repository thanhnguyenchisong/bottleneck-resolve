Follow these parts in order:

1. `01-helm-basics.md` — what Helm is, install, core commands, repo basics.
2. `02-chart-authoring.md` — chart structure, Chart.yaml, dependencies, hooks.
3. `03-values-and-templating.md` — values, templates, functions, common patterns.
4. `04-release-ops.md` — install/upgrade/rollback, diffs, testing, CI basics.
5. `05-advanced-patterns.md` — subcharts, library charts, JSON schema, security, chart testing.

Use `helm --help` and `helm template` while reading to validate understanding.

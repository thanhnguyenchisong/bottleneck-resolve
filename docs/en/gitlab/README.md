## GitLab CI/CD crash-to-pro guide

Read in order:

1. `01-basics.md` — runners, .gitlab-ci.yml anatomy, quickstart pipeline.
2. `02-pipelines-and-config.md` — stages/jobs, rules/only/except, artifacts, caches, templates.
3. `03-advanced-and-security.md` — environments, deployments, approvals, security scans, variables/protection, includes.

Use a sample `.gitlab-ci.yml` and a shared or local runner to practice while reading.

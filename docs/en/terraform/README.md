## Terraform crash-to-expert guide

Read in order:

1. `01-basics.md` — what Terraform is, install, CLI fundamentals.
2. `02-workflow-and-state.md` — init/plan/apply/destroy, backends, workspaces.
3. `03-modules-and-reuse.md` — module structure, registry, composition, variables/outputs.
4. `04-testing-and-ci.md` — fmt/validate/tflint/checkov, unit/integration tests, CI flow.
5. `05-advanced-and-security.md` — locking, drift detection, secrets handling, code quality, multi-env patterns.

Use `terraform fmt/validate/plan` as you go to practice.

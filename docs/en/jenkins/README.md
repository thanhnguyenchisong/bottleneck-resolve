## Jenkins crash-to-pro guide

Follow these parts in order:

1. `01-basics.md` — what Jenkins is, install options, core concepts, UI tour.
2. `02-pipelines.md` — Declarative vs Scripted pipelines, Jenkinsfile examples, shared libs.
3. `03-ci-cd-practices.md` — agents, credentials, quality gates, caching, security/hardening.

Use `docker run jenkins/jenkins:lts` or a local server while reading to practice.
